    <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
    <!--Mercury-->
    <h2 class="section5"></h2>
    <p>
      Only slightly larger than the Earth's moon Mercury is the closest planet
      to the Sun. Despite it's proximity to the sun it does not have the highest
      temperatures on account of the thin atmosphere. This means that heat is
      not trapped during the daytime and dissipates at night. Causing the
      temperature to reach as low as 279 below Fahrenheit.

    <!--Venus-->
    <h2 class="section4"></h2>
    <p>Second closest planet to the Sun and the hottest. A similar size to earth but that is attribute they have in common. It is the hottest planet in the solar system due to it's thick atmosphere. The heat that is trapped underneath creates temperatures as hight as 900 degrees Fahrenheit. It has a rocky surface and me even be home to active volcanos. It takes longer than a year for a day to pass on Venus. This is because of its slow rotation. </p>

    <!--Info about Earth-->
    <h2 class="section3"></h2>
    <p>The fifth largest planet in the solar system and the only one known to support life. Earth sits in what experts call the "Habitable Zone". This means the temperature is just right to support life. Earth also features bodies of water essential for living organisms. It is comprised of rock and metal. </p>
