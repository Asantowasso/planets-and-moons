        Only slightly larger than the Earth's moon Mercury is the closest planet
        to the Sun. Despite it's proximity to the sun it does not have the
        highest temperatures on account of the thin atmosphere. This means that
        heat is not trapped during the daytime and dissipates at night. Causing
        the temperature to reach as low as 279 below Fahrenheit.

        Second closest planet to the Sun and the hottest. A similar size to
        earth but that is attribute they have in common. It is the hottest
        planet in the solar system due to it's thick atmosphere. The heat that
        is trapped underneath creates temperatures as hight as 900 degrees
        Fahrenheit. It has a rocky surface and me even be home to active
        volcanos. It takes longer than a year for a day to pass on Venus. This
        is because of its slow rotation.

        The fifth largest planet in the solar system and the only one known to
        support life. Earth sits in what experts call the "Habitable Zone". This
        means the temperature is just right to support life. Earth also features
        bodies of water essential for living organisms. It is comprised of rock
        and metal.

        Known as the "Red Planet" Mars is one of the most studied planets in our
        solar system. The enviornment of Mars is arid and cold. It also has
        geographic features such as canyons and ice caps. On account of its
        distance from the sun Mar's seasons are twice as long as those on earth.

    <p>
      The most apparent fixture in our night sky the moon has not only inspired
      humanity to explore our solar system. The moon also has an impact on the
      weather here on earth by moderating Earth's wobble on it's axis. The tides
      of Earth's oceans are also impacted by the Moon's distance from our
      planet.

    <p>
      Defined by it's signature stripes and swirls Jupiter is the largest planet
      in our solar system. This appearance is created by the treacherous
      atmosphere that envelops the planet. Typified by the large spot that is a
      storm greater in size than Earth. This atmosphere is composed of hydrogen
      and helium streaked with clouds of ammonia and water. Jupiter has four
      moons that feature subterranean bodies of water and volcanos.

      Saturn's rings comprised of ice and rock are it's defining feature. They
      are also a relatively new addition to our solar system dating back a few
      hundred million years. Scientists speculate that the rings may have been
      formed by an asteroid striking a moon and the pieces were caught in the
      planet's orbit.

    <!--Uranus-->
    <h2 class="section8"></h2>
    <section class="planetdiv">
    <p>
      This frigid planet was the first to be discovered with a telescope. This
      was by astronomer William Herschel in 1781. It is far larger than earth
      and entirely unsuitable to support life. The planet and it's surrounding
      bodies move through space sideways. The cause for this is not known but it
      is speculated to have been caused by a large object colliding with the
      planet.

    <p>
      Neptune is impossible to spot by looking into the night sky and was
      speculated to exist before being seen by humans. Its enviornment is
      extremely cold and subject to supersonic winds. It is the farthest from
      the sun in our solar system. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have
      visited it. Passing the planet on it's way out of our solar system in
      1989. The methane in it's atmosphere is what gives the atmosphere a deep
      blue coloration. This is caused by the absorption of red light.
